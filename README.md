# Electron-Stream-Player
A player that can play any webstream, built on Electron


## What is this?

It's a work in progress video player built on the [video.js](https://videojs.com/) framework.

This was first made as a companion app to my [Rooster Teeth stream program](https://github.com/2haloes/RT-Stream-App)

I soon relized that I don't need to do everything that I first thought of which resulted in the companion app being forked

But I would like to make a player that could be used to play any media using video.js and the plugins that can also be used with it

## Why use an MPL license?

I don't want to just let this loose with no rescrictions, a weak copyleft license wouldn't help me too much

But the GPL just doesn't sit right with me, I want someone to use this if they wanted to

The MPL sits well with me, mixing some GPL with some weaker licenses.

MPL requires modifications to be shared as well as source code to be provided

But it also allows this to be a part of larger works without a web of issues
